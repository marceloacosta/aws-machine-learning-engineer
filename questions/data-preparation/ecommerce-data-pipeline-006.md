# Data Preparation: Building an E-commerce ML Data Pipeline

## Question
An e-commerce company aims to enhance its predictive model for customer churn by incorporating data from various sources. The company plans to train its model using comprehensive datasets, including purchase histories, website activity, user profiles, and social media interactions.

To achieve this, the company needs to:

1. Extract and combine data from Amazon RDS databases, Amazon DynamoDB, and other data sources to create a unified dataset for training the machine learning model.
2. Store the combined dataset in a cost-effective and scalable storage solution for both training and inference.
3. Analyze large volumes of purchase history data using a distributed computing framework.
4. Ingest, transform, and load real-time social media activity data.

Match the appropriate AWS service or solution to each requirement from the options provided. Each option may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

A. Extract and combine data from various sources:
   - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
   - AWS Glue ‚úì

B. Store the combined dataset:
   - Amazon S3 ‚úì

C. Analyze large volumes of purchase history:
   - Amazon EMR ‚úì
